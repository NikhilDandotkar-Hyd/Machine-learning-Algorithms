# KNN[K Nearest Neighbours]
KNN  is supervised learning algorithm. Which means each data point requires a corresponding labels.
In this algorithm there is only inference(no training process). 
In the inference is done in two steps
### Step-1:
Calculate the distance between the test data point and all the training data points.
### Step-2:
Consider the k shortest distance of all the distances and
