# KNN[K Nearest Neighbours]
KNN  is supervised learning algorithm. Which means each data point requires a corresponding labels.
In this algorithm there is only inference(no training process). 

In the inference is done in two steps
##### Step-1:
Calculate the distance between the test data point and all the training data points.
##### Step-2:
Consider the k shortest distances of all the distances. Mode of the corresponding k labels will be the label of the test data point.


when the number of data points increase in the training data set calculating distance between test data point and training data point becomes challenging. 

There are 3 methods to calculate the distance and which method will help to overcome this challenge will be addressed.

### Method-1
### Method-2
### Method-3
